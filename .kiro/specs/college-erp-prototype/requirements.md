# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple, fully functional college ERP prototype built with Next.js and Material UI. The system will provide role-based dashboards for Admin, Teacher, Student, and Alumni users with essential functionality for managing academic operations. The prototype emphasizes minimal code, mock data usage, and shared components to demonstrate core ERP capabilities efficiently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log into the system by selecting my role and account, so that I can access the appropriate dashboard for my responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display role selection options (Admin, Teacher, Student, Alumni)
2. WHEN a user selects a role THEN the system SHALL display available accounts for that role
3. WHEN a user selects an account and clicks login THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and store their session in localStorage
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to their role-specific dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage all system entities and post notices, so that I can oversee the entire college operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL display tables for teachers, students, classes, and alumni
2. WHEN an admin clicks add entry THEN the system SHALL provide forms to create new teachers, students, or classes
3. WHEN an admin submits a new entry THEN the system SHALL save the data to localStorage and update the display
4. WHEN an admin posts a notice THEN the system SHALL add it to the notices list visible to all users
5. WHEN an admin views alumni requests THEN the system SHALL display pending alumni applications with approve/reject options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to manage my assigned classes and track student progress, so that I can fulfill my teaching responsibilities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher logs in THEN the system SHALL display their assigned subject and classes (maximum 2-3 classes per teacher)
2. WHEN a teacher selects a class and lecture THEN the system SHALL show the student roster for attendance marking for that specific lecture
3. WHEN a teacher marks attendance for a lecture THEN the system SHALL save attendance data with date, class, and lecture number to localStorage
4. WHEN a teacher enters grades THEN the system SHALL update student grade records for their subject in localStorage
5. WHEN a teacher views class performance THEN the system SHALL display lecture-wise attendance and subject grades for their classes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view my academic progress and profile information, so that I can track my performance and stay informed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student logs in THEN the system SHALL display their complete profile including name, DOB, admission number, address, phone, and email
2. WHEN a student views attendance THEN the system SHALL display a compiled attendance report showing lecture-wise attendance across all subjects and overall attendance percentage
3. WHEN a student views grades THEN the system SHALL display their current grades across all subjects
4. WHEN a student views rewards THEN the system SHALL display earned badges based on performance criteria
5. WHEN a student views notices THEN the system SHALL display all posted announcements
6. WHEN the system calculates badges THEN it SHALL automatically assign "Excellent Attendance" for ≥90% overall attendance and "Top Performer" for ≥85% average grades

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an alumni member, I want to connect with other alumni and participate in events, so that I can maintain my relationship with the institution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an alumni logs in THEN the system SHALL display the alumni directory
2. WHEN an alumni views events THEN the system SHALL show upcoming alumni events with dates and descriptions
3. WHEN an alumni submits a comment THEN the system SHALL add their testimonial to the alumni feedback list
4. WHEN an alumni applies for membership THEN the system SHALL create a pending request for admin approval
5. WHEN an alumni views their profile THEN the system SHALL display their graduation year and current status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use shared components and minimal code, so that the application is maintainable and lightweight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing dashboards THEN the system SHALL use a single shared layout template that dynamically adjusts content based on user role
2. WHEN managing data THEN the system SHALL use centralized getData() and saveData() utility functions
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL initialize mock data in localStorage if not already present
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use default MUI themes with minimal customization
5. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL maintain no more than 4-6 files total
6. WHEN handling navigation THEN the system SHALL use state switching or Next.js routing based on code efficiency

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want data to persist across sessions, so that my work is not lost when I close the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs any data operation THEN the system SHALL save changes to localStorage immediately
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve existing data from localStorage
3. WHEN localStorage is empty THEN the system SHALL initialize with comprehensive mock data including multiple teachers (each teaching 1 subject in 2-3 classes), students, classes (with up to 7 lectures each), alumni, notices, and events
4. WHEN data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and reinitialize if necessary

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be intuitive and responsive, so that I can efficiently complete my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation and action buttons
2. WHEN viewing tables THEN the system SHALL display data in organized, readable formats using MUI components
3. WHEN submitting forms THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on success or errors
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL be responsive across different screen sizes
5. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately to reflect changes
