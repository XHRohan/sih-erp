# 🎓 College ERP System - A Simple Guide

## What is this?

Imagine you're running a college and need to keep track of everything - students, teachers, classes, grades, attendance, and fees. Instead of using paper files and spreadsheets, this **College ERP System** is like a digital assistant that helps manage all these things in one place!

**ERP** stands for "Educational Resource Planning" - it's basically a smart system that helps colleges organize and manage their daily operations.
